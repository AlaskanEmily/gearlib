Gearlib
=======

Gearlib is a library to generate meshes of gears.

Implemented in Mercury, Gearlib is most likely to be useful for applications written in Mercury, or Java, C#, or Erlang through bindings.

The code is released under the zlib license.

What works
----------

* Generating cylinders with variable tesselation
* Generating gears with variable tooth count and depth

TODO
----

* Java and C# interfaces (more than just what Mercury outputs)
* Options for gear shapes (octoroidal, sawtooth, S-curve)
* Options for gear tooth tesselation
* Bevel gears
